## Create a map using data gethered from earthquake.usgs.gov

# Trouble early
I was struggling early on and was recieving a container error. After much google-foo I found the culpret and just simply had to change the id for the map on the html. Not totally certain on why this fixed the issue but I know where to look first next time.

# Thoughts
This was one of my favorite assignments. I am a big fan of instant feed back espcially through visuals. So once I had the map running and I could play with it, I had a lot of fun.

# If I had more time
I would definitely go back and personalize the assignment further. When I was searching for an asnwer to a question on google when returning an error from the way we did it in class, I would run into a bunch of differnet angles of going about it entirely. Some offer alot more customization and I would like to go back and clean it up and make it more visually  appealing for my portfolio. I was actually trying to explain this to my brother, who knows nothing about coding, and he was less impressed by what the script was doing and more focused on the aesthetic of the map. As for the more data option portion, I am not sure I will likely do it to a T because I dont want to bottleneck myself into forcing some specific output but rather play with it and see where the creative juices take me.
